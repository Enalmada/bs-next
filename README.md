# bs-next

[BuckleScript](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript) bindings for [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

## Status

As far as I know they only export 2 components and that is the entire API surface. If I'm wrong please file an issue.

The target for this is version 3 of next.
